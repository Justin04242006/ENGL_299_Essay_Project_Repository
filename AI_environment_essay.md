###Introductory paragraph

#Intriguing statstic: in the state of Illinois alone, 4.833 million liters of water (from both cooling datacenters and generating the electricity to power the datacenters) was used by Microsoft to train its GPT-3 model (Li et al. 2025). This does not include the water used to manufacture the semiconductor chips for the comapny's computers. 

#Connect this statistic to why datacenter water footprint matters as AI models scale up and become more widely used. Incorporate quotes from "Making AI less 'Thirsty'" and "AI_embedded data centres" to lend credence to this idea. 

#Explain that your paper explores solutions to reduce AI's water footprint that are simulatenosuly energy and carbon cognizant, addressing the counterargument that criticizes you for focusing solely on water footprint. Use this as a chance to introduce the conceptual frameworks of systems thinking and rebound effects. 

#Explain the three types of datacenter water usage and briefly list some of the solutions that can be implemented to mitigate these uses. Explain that the most water efficient method for a datacenter varies greatly depending on location, therefore arguing for a universalizable solution is not realistic. Introduce Chicago data centers as the focus of your paper. 

#Chicago's climatic trends and the city's proximity to a large freshwater body of water present unique opportunities and challenges for water efficient datacenter development. 

##Main claim: to reduce their water footprints while simulatneously minimizing other environmental footprints and rebound effects, datacenters in Chicago should use direct-to-chip cooling with Lake Michigan water, primarily use electricity produced from solar power to run their operations, and purchase semiconductors from companies that make efforts to reduce or offset manufacturing water footprint.



###Body Paragraph 1: Scope 1 Water Use

##Subclaim: direct-to-chip server cooling, accomplished by circulating Lake Michigan water into and back out of a datacenter, is the most water efficient method of cooling a datacenter in Chicago and presents the fewest rebound effects.

#Reason 1: Chicago is located on the lake and thus has direct access to its freshwater. 

###Reasons 2 and 3 address this counterargument: If the goal is a water efficient cooling method, why not simply use air conditioning?

#Reason 2: In-room air cooling systems cool the entire datacenter space and thus lack the ability to provide adequate cooling to the hottest server components, making it water efficient but energy intensive. 

#Reason 3: In-rack air cooling systems have better ability to cool individual server components, but when the components heat up beyond a certian point, the air is no longer able to absorb enough heat. This requires the use of a medium with a higher specific heat capacity: water.

#Reason 4: Direct to chip cooling coupled with the circulation of natural Lake Michigan water would eliminate the need for a cooling tower, which evaporates water to remove heat from the water cooling system and thus has a water consumption footprint. 



###Body Paragraph 2: Scope 2 Water Use

##Subclaim: Electricity produced from solar power, specifically solar panels, is the most water and energy-efficient source of power for datacenters in Chicago. 

#Reason 1: PV cells have very minimal water footprint, if any.

#Counterargument (which reason 2 addresses): wait a minute, fella. If you're all about systems thinking and avoiding unforeseen consequences, what do you make of the embodied carbon footprint of the solar panels themselves?

#Reason 2: The materials comprising solar panels are often recyclable when the solar panel ceases to function. Modern methods of solar panel manufacturing are becoming more efficient (include information from the source below to explain how!!!)

#Reason 3: While geothermal energy is often used for heating and cooling buildings in Chicago, Chicago does not possess enough avaialble undergorudn thermal energy to be used for large-scale electricity generation. Also, geothermal energy posseses a consumptive water footprint (namely, the use of water for hydraulic fracturing).

#Reason 4: While hydrogen fuel cells have zero water footprint with respect to the processes they use to create electricity (water is actually a byproduct of this process, not a reagent), the embodied carbon footprint of the processes used to produce the hydrogen mean it is not the most holistically sustainable solution for Chicago datacenters despite its water efficiency.



###Body Paragraph 3: Scope 3 Water Use

##Subclaim: Purchasing semiconductors from companies that make cosncious efforts to reduce the water footprint of their manufacturing processes is the best, and perhaps, the only way of reducing the Scope 3 water footprint of datacenters in Chicago (or anywhere else). 

#Reason 1: explain that many semiconductor manfuacturing comapnies, including Intel and  have implemented measures to reduce the massive water footprint connected to semiconductor chip manufacturing.

#Reason 2: Describe water conservation and efficiency efforts made by the Intel semiconductor manufacturing company.
