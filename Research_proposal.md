Scope of my project

As the use of generative AI has increased in the three years since the release of ChatGPT, concenrs regarding LLMs' consumption of energy and natural resources have increased as well.
I plan to examine the negative environmental impacts of AI usage.
By doing so, I strive to determine the mechanisms causing such negative impacts and compare each impact's severities in the short and long term.
With this understanding, I hope to improve the ability of developers of AI software, engineers of AI data managment systems, and AI users to make informed decisions that reduce AI's environmental footprint.
AI's environmental footrpint is crucial to consider as a growing anthropogenic environmental influence with the potential to compound the effects of other anthropogenic contributions to the global climate change crisis. 

Methods

I plan to draw from a variety of scholarly sources, including articles written by scientific and economic journals, university research departments, reputable news organizations, and government environmental organizations.
I will utilize Zotero for source trcking and citation mangagement, Obsidian for note taking, and Visual Studio Code for essay outlining, drafting, and revision. 
I will use Git to keep track of version history throughout the entire writing process.
The final project will be a public GitHub repository containing my essay (as a Markdown file), the accompanying version history of the essay, and this research proposal.
