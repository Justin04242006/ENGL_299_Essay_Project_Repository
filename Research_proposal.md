Statement of context, topic, question, problem, and significance of the problem 

As the use of generative AI has increased in the three years since the release of ChatGPT, concerns regarding LLMs' consumption of energy and natural resources have increased as well.
I plan to examine the negative environmental impacts of AI usage.
By doing so, I strive to determine the mechanisms causing such negative impacts and compare each impact's severity in the short and long term.
With this understanding, I hope that developers of AI software, engineers of AI data managment systems, and AI users will be better equipped to make informed decisions to reduce AI's environmental footprint.
AI's environmental footrpint is crucial to consider as a growing anthropogenic environmental influence because it has the  potential to compound the effects of other anthropogenic contributions to the global climate change crisis. 

Methods and process

I plan to draw from a variety of scholarly sources, including articles written by scientific and economic journals, university research departments, reputable news organizations, and government environmental organizations.
I will utilize Zotero for source tracking and citation mangagement, Obsidian for note taking, and Visual Studio Code for essay outlining, drafting, and revision. 
I am currently searching Loyola libararies research databases and compiling promising secondary sources into Zotero. 
I used Visual Studio Code to write this proposal.
I do not plan on extensively using pencil and paper during the writing process.
I will use Git to keep track of version history throughout the entire writing process.
The final project will be a public GitHub repository containing my essay (as a Markdown file), the accompanying version history of the essay, and this research proposal.
